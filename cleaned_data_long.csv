Cutting spending over increases over the last two years is clearly an attempt to pull the wool over Alaskan's eyes.
In NANA's downgrade, Moody's gives us their rationale which is liquidity driven; discourage borrowing; discourage debt. The three credit agency's have down graded our credit worthiness out of concern over spending and fiscal discipline.

In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place.
